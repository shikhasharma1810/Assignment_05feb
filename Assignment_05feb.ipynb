    "2.Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four pillars are Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance\n",
    "In Python it is possible to create an object that inherits the methods and properties of another object. This is called \n",
    "inheritance. In inheritance, there is a parent class and a child class. A child class inherits the properties and methods \n",
    "of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism simply means 'many forms'. In Python this means that you can have one function or object that can be used in\n",
    "different ways. Let us take an example of the addition operator (+); we can use it to add numbers, but we can also use it \n",
    "to concatenate strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of making data private by wrapping data and its methods in a 'capsule' or unit, so that it \n",
    "can not be accessed or modified outside of that unit. This is achieved by making variables inside a class private. \n",
    "In Python we can make variables private by prefixing the variable name with a double underscore '__'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction\n",
    "The fourth pillar of OOP is Abstraction. Abstraction is about keeping the process simple by hiding unnecessary details \n",
    "from the user. Think of a car; the actual mechanism that keeps a car moving is hidden from the user. It is important to \n",
    "know how to drive a car; but it is not necessarily important to know what happens under the hood when you drive the car. \n",
    "Abstraction is about keeping the internal mechanics of the code hidden from the user. This reduces the complexity of the\n",
    "code, and ensures that we only concentrate on what is important."

    "3.Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "__init__ is a special python method that runs whenever a new object is created. These types of functions are used to \n",
    "initialize the attributes of that class, E.g., if the class is Person, then the attributes will be name, age, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other Object-Oriented Languages(like C++, and Java), these types of functions are called constructors. \n",

    "\n",
    "The self variable is used to represent the instance of the class which is often used in object-oriented programming. \n",
